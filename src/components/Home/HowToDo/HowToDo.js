            <p>Over time your bike will go through a lot of wear and tear. Sometimes it’s only when we come face to face with a mechanical problem that we realise how fragile a bike can be. Even the small failures can make a huge impact on the functionality of the bike. Little problems such as moved brake pads can subtly cause your braking power to decrease. <br/> Aim to get your bike checked over every few months. Obviously, this is all dependent on how often you cycle. During the winter season the bike can get in a bad state from the debris picked up off the wet and muddy conditions, so pay particular attention during this time.</p>
